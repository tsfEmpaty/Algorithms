# Maximize Expression

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the largest
possible value for the expression
<code>array[a] - array[b] + array[c] - array[d]</code>, where <code>a</code>,
<code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, and <code>d</code> are indices of the array
and <code>a < b < c < d</code>.

If the input array has fewer than <code>4</code> elements, your function
should return <code>0</code>.

## Sample Input

```python
array = [3, 6, 1, -3, 2, 7]
```

## Sample Output

```javascript
4
// Choose a = 1, b = 3, c = 4, and d = 5
// -> 6 - (-3) + 2 - 7 = 4
```

The brute-force approach to solving this problem is to simply iterate through
every valid choice of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, and
<code>d</code> and to evaluate the expression at each iteration. While doing
this, you can keep track of the maximum value that you find and return it
after considering all possibilities. This solution runs in
<code>O(n^4)</code> time; can you think of a way to solve this faster?

You can solve this problem using dynamic programming with a time complexity of
<code>O(n)</code>; however, you'll need to use external space.

  <summary>Hint 3</summary>

If you know what the maximum possible value of <code>a</code> is at each index
in the array, you can find the maximum possible value of <code>a - b</code> at
each individual index in the array in <code>O(1)</code> time (or in
<code>O(n)</code> time for all indices). The same thing holds for finding the
maximum possible value of <code>a - b + c</code> if you know the maximum
possible value of <code>a - b</code> at each index. How does this fact help
you solve the entire problem in <code>O(n)</code> time?

<details>
  <summary>Hint 4</summary>

Start by finding the maximum possible value of <code>a</code> at each index in
the array, meaning the maximum value of <code>a</code> that you can obtain at
each index <code>i</code> if <code>a</code> is chosen from an index between
<code>0</code> and <code>i</code>, inclusive. Store all of these values in an
array, and use them to help you determine the maximum possible value of
<code>a - b</code> at each index. Do the same for
<code>a - b + c</code> (using the results from <code>a - b</code>) and
<code>a - b + c - d</code> (using the results from <code>a - b + c</code>).
Once you make it to <code>a - b + c - d</code>, you'll be able to determine
the maximum value of the expression.
