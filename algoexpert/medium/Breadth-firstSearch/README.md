# Breadth-first Search

You're given a <code>Node</code> class that has a <code>name</code> and an
array of optional <code>children</code> nodes. When put together, nodes form
an acyclic tree-like structure.

Implement the <code>breadthFirstSearch</code> method on the
<code>Node</code> class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree
using the Breadth-first Search approach (specifically navigating the tree from
left to right), stores all of the nodes' names in the input array, and returns
it.

If you're unfamiliar with Breadth-first Search, we recommend watching the
Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before
starting to code.

## Sample Input

```python
graph = A
     /  |  \
    B   C   D
   / \     / \
  E   F   G   H
     / \   \
    I   J   K
```

## Sample Output

```python
["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K"]
```

  <summary>Hint 1</summary>

The Breadth-first Search algorithm works by traversing a graph level by level. In other words, before traversing any Node's children Nodes, its sibling nodes must be traversed. How can you simply and effectively keep track of Nodes' children Nodes as you traverse them, all the while retaining the order in which you must traverse them?

  <summary>Hint 2</summary>

Try using a queue to store all of the future Nodes that you will need to explore as your traverse the graph. By adding Nodes' children Nodes to the queue every time you explore them and by using the First-In-First-Out property of the queue, you can traverse the graph in a Breadth-first Search way. Don't forget to add every Node's name to the input array as you traverse the graph.

  <summary>Optimal Space & Time Complexity</summary>

O(v + e) time | O(v) space - where v is the number of vertices of the input graph and e is the number of edges of the input graph
