# First Non-Repeating Character

Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters
and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character.

The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that
occurs only once.

If the input string doesn't have any non-repeating characters, your function
should return <code>-1</code>.

## Sample Input

```python
string = "abcdcaf"
```

## Sample Output

```javascript
1 // The first non-repeating character is "b" and is found at index 1.
```

How can you determine if a character only appears once in the entire input
string? What would be the brute-force approach to solve this problem?

One way to solve this problem is with nested traversals of the string: you
start by traversing the string, and for each character that you traverse, you
traverse through the entire string again to see if the character appears
anywhere else. The first index at which you find a character that doesn't
appear anywhere else in the string is the index that you return. This approach
works, but it's not optimal. Are there any data structures that you can use to
improve the time complexity of this approach?

Hash tables are very commonly used to keep track of frequencies. Build a hash
table, where every key is a character in the string and every value is the
corresponding character's frequency in the input string. You can traverse the
entire string once to fill the hash table, and then with a second traversal
through the string (not a nested traversal), you can use the hash table's
constant-time lookups to find the first character with a frequency of
<code>1</code>.

  <summary>Optimal Space & Time Complexity</summary>

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input string
The constant space is because the input string only has lowercase
English-alphabet letters; thus, our hash table will never have more
than 26 character frequencies.
